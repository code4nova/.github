## Code for NoVA

**⛑️A Code for America Brigade⛑️**

Situated in Northern VA (thus the NoVA bit), we are a group of developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help Arlington County, Alexandria City, and Fairfax County governments and civic orgs adopt open web technologies. We are revitalizing the group and would love to welcome more people aboard!
